monetio's mission is to make cloud based budgeting available for everyone free of charge.
Operating cost must be paid by donations from users. If the operating cost exceeds available donations, operation will be ceased until financials is balanced.

I am developing and operating monetio alone. All costs are on me. I have a work and family too.
I choosed cloud services with generous free tiers to make the mission feasible.

Guidelines coming soon for contributions.
